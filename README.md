# Highcharts React
Official minimal [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) wrapper for React

## Getting Started

### Installing

Get package from github with npm or yarn

```bash
npm install highcharts-react-official highcharts react react-dom
```

### Using

#### Basic usage example

Import into your React project and render a:

##### Highcharts chart

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import Highcharts from 'highcharts'
import HighchartsReact from 'highcharts-react-official'

const options = {
  title: {
    text: 'My chart'
  },
  series: [{
    data: [1, 2, 3]
  }]
}

const App = () => <div>
  <HighchartsReact
    highcharts={Highcharts}
    options={options}
  />
</div>

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

##### Highstock chart

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock'
import HighchartsReact from 'highcharts-react-official'

const options = {
  title: {
    text: 'My stock chart'
  },
  series: [{
    data: [1, 2, 3]
  }]
}

const App = () => <div>
  <HighchartsReact
    highcharts={Highcharts}
    constructorType={'stockChart'}
    options={options}
  />
</div>

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

##### Highmaps chart

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import Highcharts from 'highcharts'
import HC_map from 'highcharts/modules/map'
import HighchartsReact from 'highcharts-react-official'

// init the module
HC_map(Highcharts)

// instead of import + init you could use require as:
// require('highcharts/modules/map')(Highcharts)
// the same allpies to any other Highcharts module

const options = {
  title: {
    text: 'My map chart'
  },
  series: [{
    // any meaningful map data is much larger,
    // but it should go in here
    data: [1, 2, 3]
  }]
}

const App = () => <div>
  <HighchartsReact
    highcharts={Highcharts}
    constructorType={'mapChart'}
    options={options}
  />
</div>

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

### Options explained

```jsx
  <HighchartsReact
    highcharts={Highcharts}
    constructorType={'mapChart'}
    options={options}
    update={update}
  />
```

#### highcharts

Used to pass the Highcharts instance after modules are initialized.
If not set the component will try to get the Highcharts from window.

#### constructorType

Defaults to `'chart'`. Other official constructors are:

- `'stockChart'` for Highstock charts
- `'mapChart'` for Highmaps charts

If you have added a module or a plugin that adds new contructor then you can use it and set using this property.

#### options

Options that will be used for a chart. Please refer to the Highcharts [API documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/).

#### update

Update will run when checking in `shouldComponentUpdate` if this property is not specified or set to `true`.

or use oneToOne

`oneToOne={true}`

The option is **optional**, defaults to `false`. The `oneToOne` parameter for [updates](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.Chart#update). When true, the `series`, `xAxis` and `yAxis` collections will be updated one to one, and items will be either added or removed to match the new updated options. For example, if the chart has **two** series and we call `chart.update` (and this is called on each chart's data change or if `updateFlag` is set to true) with a configuration containing **three** series, **one** will be added. If we call `chart.update` with **one** series, **one** will be removed. Setting an empty series array will remove all series, but leaving out the series property will leave all series untouched. If the series have id's, the new series options will be matched by id, and the remaining ones removed.


### Usage example with custom chart component

Create custom component `./components/MyStockChart.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock'
import HighchartsReact from 'highcharts-react-official'

const options = {
  title: {
    text: 'My stock chart'
  },
  series: [{
    data: [1, 2, 3]
  }]
}

const MyStockChart = () => <HighchartsReact
  highcharts={Highcharts}
  constructorType={'stockChart'}
  options={options}
/>

export default MyStockChart
```

Render your custom chart component like below:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import MyStockChart from './components/MyStockChart.jsx'

const App = () => <div>
  <MyStockChart />
</div>

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```
